# Computer Logic
A computer in a way is a tool to help you think.  The pioneers realized it needed to do four different tasks:
* Input
* Storage
* Processing
* Output

Input is what you do that makes the computer do things, such as a mouse, keyboard, touch inputs, etc.

All those inputs are then stores which gives it a memory to store.  

The storage then takes that information and processes it with an algorithm.

Once it has processed that information, it then outputs that information which depends on what the computer was designed to do.  This could be what is shown on a screen, such as text, a game, etc.

Binary is made of 0 and 1.  With those two digits it can count to any number. It multiplies and adds those numbers.  For example the number 9 in binary would be 1001 which is (1x8)+(0x4)+(0x2)+(1x1).  Essentially information consists of binary.

Input devices take information from the outside world and converts it into binary.  That then gets sent to the memory to store the information and the CPU calculates that information.  The outpute devices then take that information and presents it to us in some way.
