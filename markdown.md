# Markdown Notes

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight syntax for styling content.

## Some useful Markdown syntaxes
* Adding images:
```
![](Url to the image)
or
![Add an Alt Text if needed](Url to the image)
```
* Creating an unordered list:
```
- Item
- Item 2
- Item 3

or

* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```


## Notes
* Having the file extension as ".md" will make it into a Markdown file.
