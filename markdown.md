# Markdown Notes

## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight syntax for styling content.

## Some useful Markdown syntaxes
* Adding images:
```
![](Url to the image)
or
![Add an Alt Text if needed](Url to the image)
```
```
* Creating an unordered list:
- Item
- Item 2
- Item 3
or
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

* Adding a link:
```
[Name of the site or the actual URL itself](URL goes here)
```
* Creating a table:
```
Row 1 | Column 2
Row 2 | Column 2
```
* How to bold or italicize your text:
```
*This will italicize your text*
_This will italicize your text_

**This will bold your text**
__This will bold your text__
```

## Notes
* Having the file extension as ".md" will make it into a Markdown file.
