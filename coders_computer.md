## Differences Between Text Editors and Its Importance
For the most part, they do the same task.  At least when it comes to text editors for coding purposes.  Even regular pre-installed text editors such as Notepad can get the job done. Still, it may not be as efficient as something explicitly aimed at coding.  However, each coding text editor seems to have its own unique feature(s).

Some important features of a text editor for coding consists of the following:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Abilities to change the theme of the editor to reduce any possible eye strain.
* Being able to add extensions to aid with your efficiency.

Some of these features aim to help certain use-cases.  For example, some text editors will create a project structure and necessary files needed, which saves you the time and hassle of creating them.  Some may even display possible suggestions based on the code you're typing, and you could click on it to complete it rather than typing the entire string of code yourself.

Then there's IDEs which serves as an all-in-one sort of package.  It consists of a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger.  That may be needed for certain programming languages.
