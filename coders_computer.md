## Differences Between Text Editors and Its Importance
For the most part, they do the same task.  At least when it comes to text editors for coding purposes.  Even regular pre-installed text editors such as Notepad can get the job done. Still, it may not be as efficient as something explicitly aimed at coding.  However, each coding text editor seems to have its own unique feature(s).

Some important features of a text editor for coding consists of the following:
* Code completion
* Syntax highlighting
* Abilities to change the theme of the editor to reduce any possible eye strain.
* Being able to add extensions to aid with your efficiency.

Some of these features aim to help certain use-cases.  For example, some text editors will create a project structure and necessary files needed, which saves you the time and hassle of creating them.  Some may even display possible suggestions based on the code you're typing, and you could click on it to complete it rather than typing the entire string of code yourself.

Then there's IDEs which serves as an all-in-one sort of package.  It consists of a text editor, file manager, compiler, and a debugger.  That may be needed for certain programming languages.

## Third-Party Options
Here are some third-party options available, some are free and some are not:
* Notepad++
* TextWrangler (retired)
* BB  Edit
* Visual Studio Code
* Atom
* Brackets
* Sublime Text

## Terminals
They serve as a text based interface to a system.  You can enter commands for it to carry out and display it's feedback all via a text based interface.  Commands are also separated out by spaces.

Here are some commands and it's functions:

**echo**: Will let you know which shell you are using to display a system variable stating your current shell.  For example you may use **echo $SHELL**.  

**pwd**: Print Working Directory tells you what your current present working directory is.

**ls**: Lists your documents and files in your current directory.

**ls -a**: Lists your documents and files including hidden files unlike the command above.

**cd**: Change Directory lets you move around in your system.

**file**: Lets you obtain information about the file or directory type.

Using these commands, one must also be mindful that Linux is very case sensitive unlike other systems.  Spacing is another important aspect when specifying files or directories.  For example if a file contains a space in it's name, one must specify it between single or double quotes.
