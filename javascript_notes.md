# JavaScript Notes
JavaScript is more of an object oriented language unlike HTML and CSS.  It's sort of what's behind the webpage, the backend layer of it.  It lets you create dynamic updating content.

HTML is the foundation,  while CSS is the design, and then Javascript is the function that makes things work.  Think of it as the hinges or handles to the doors, or the electricity that runs the stove.  The JavaScript syntax is basically a set of rules.



- Values are either literal or variables.
- Strings are text and they're written within double or single quotations
- Variables are used to store data values that you can refer to in your code.  For example, if you had to run a program that mentioned every single food item billy ate, instead you can just assign all those food items to simply "food." Example:
```javascript
var person = "Bruce Lee";
var answer1 = "yes";
var answer2 = "no";
```
- Operators are either to compute values or to assign values to variables.
- Booleans are true or false statements.
