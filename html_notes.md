# HTML Notes
HTML, in a way, is the building block of your site.  You're pretty much structuring the layout of it before you stylize it with CSS.  However, people did stylize their content in the past without using CSS, which is now not recommended or common practice anymore.

Over the years there have been different versions of HTML.  Each version brings in a new standard of coding in HTML.  For example with HTML 4, you could style the content without CSS.  As it evolved, CSS usage was enforced more.  There are browsers new or old that may display your content differently depending on how you instruct the browser to display the content.

Using Doctypes and specifying it, makes your browser display the content according to that HTML version.
Examples:

HTML 5
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

HTML 4
```
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd">
```

XHTML
```
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.1//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/DTD/xhtml11.dtd">
```
## Some Common HTML Tags

```
<p></p>

```

Header and sizes:
```
<h1></h1<> replace the number 1 with anything up to 6
```

To group a set of elements in one block-level box:
```

```

```

## HTML Layout Elements
The header portion where your H1, logo, and or navigation goes:
```
<header>
```

The part where your main navigation link goes:
```
<nav>
```

The part where your content goes:
```

```

The part where your article goes.  In a way it acts like it's own independent container for the article:

<article>
```

The part where your footer (links pertaining to your organization or contact etc.) goes:
```
<footer>
```
